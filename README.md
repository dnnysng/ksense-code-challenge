# Ksense Code Challenge

This is a code challenge solution that I built for Ksense.

## The Challenge

Using jQuery or vanilla JS you will display each 'USER' in a table. When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'. You have full freedom in how you accomplish the above objectives. You also have full freedom as far as design is concerned. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task.

## API Reference

#### Users

```http

#### Posts

```

## Reflection

Overall I think this was a fun build and I enjoyed the challenge. Given the 2 hour time-limit I decided to focus on the functionality over design. With more time I would have liked to improve the styling of both the table and the cards for the users posts. Another feature that I think would improve this overall is if I added a title to the posts page that shows who the current author is that is being viewed.
